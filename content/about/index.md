Hello! I'm Mateusz Konefał, a passionate 27-year-old programmer with a keen interest in technology and innovation. My journey in the tech world has been self-taught and ever-evolving. 

**I am currently studying for the COMPTIA A+ certification. I am working on my HomeLab. In the near future, I plan to start learning on Hack The Box.**

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the world of ham radio – my latest hobby that combines my love of electronics, communication, and community. This interest aligns perfectly with my love for Linux and cybersecurity, as they all fuel my curiosity about how things work at a fundamental level.

Gaming remains a favorite pastime, especially on consoles like Xbox and Nintendo Switch, offering me a much-needed break and a different kind of digital adventure. Additionally, my fascination with astrophysics keeps me connected to the mysteries of the universe, reminding me of the endless possibilities both in technology and in life.

As I continue to learn and grow in this dynamic field, I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. I am always open to collaborating on projects or just having interesting discussions about technology and its impact on our world.

Let's connect and create something amazing together!
